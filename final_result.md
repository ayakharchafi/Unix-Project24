##### This case was 3D printed using a model online:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4617605
##### We made a cut in the middle to be able to access the Raspberry Pi if anything happens or if we need to add more connectors. 
##### The breadboard and the buttons are outside of the case since the user will need to press it to be able to take pictures and record.
##### We added labels next to the buttons to differentiate them apart.
##### A string is attached to the RPi(Raspberry Pi) to make it wearable and portable in case the user wants to have it over their neck and not hold it anymore.
##### We secured the case using electrical tape and we left some openings for the power connector, the mini HDMI type d connector, USB plugs and the ethernet ports. 
##### For the camera, the case can change angle, but you need to be careful because your camera v2's flex cable needs to be pulled out so you can change angles (You don't want to force the flex cable out! Pull some out first, close the case, and then you can change angles).
##### To make it portable, we connected the RPi to a portable battery charger to be able to go out and take pictures without the need to stay connected to a wall plug.
