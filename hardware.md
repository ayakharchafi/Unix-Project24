# Portable Raspberry Pi Camera System - Hardware Components

The following components are used in building the portable Raspberry Pi camera system. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the system operates smoothly and efficiently.

## 1. **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**
   - The central computing unit for the project. It provides the processing power needed to run the camera system and handle tasks such as capturing photos, recording videos, managing files, and interacting with the user.

## 2. **Camera V2**
   - The primary hardware for capturing photos and videos. The Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 provides high-quality imaging capabilities for the system.

## 3. **4-pin button x2**
   - Used to control the camera system. One button could be used to take pictures, while the other could start and stop video recording. Buttons allow for physical, real-time interaction with the system.

## 4. **Male to Female pin connectors**
   - Necessary for connecting the camera, buttons, and other components (e.g., GPIO pins) to the Raspberry Pi. They provide a stable and secure connection between the Raspberry Pi and external components.

## 5. **3D printed Case**
   - Protects the Raspberry Pi, camera module, and other components. It houses the system, ensuring that all parts are safely enclosed while maintaining accessibility to buttons, ports, and connectors.

## 6. **Breadboard**
   - Used for prototyping the connections between the Raspberry Pi and other components like buttons and sensors. It allows for easy testing and adjustments without soldering.

## 7. **SD card**
   - Stores the Raspberry Pi’s operating system and software. It also serves as the storage for photos, videos, and any other data generated by the camera system.

## 8. **HDMI cable**
   - Connects the Raspberry Pi to an external display, allowing you to view the system’s interface or camera feed on a screen.

## 9. **Power cable**
   - Supplies the Raspberry Pi with electricity. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B requires a stable 5V power supply to function properly.

## 10. **Portable battery**
   - Powers the Raspberry Pi and the camera system when used away from an electrical outlet, enabling the system to be truly portable and functional in various outdoor environments.

## 11. **Keyboard**
   - Used to interact with the Raspberry Pi for configuration, programming, or controlling the system directly through the terminal or a GUI.

## 12. **Mouse**
   - Used in conjunction with the keyboard for easy navigation through the Raspberry Pi's graphical interface, allowing for more intuitive control of the camera system.

## 13. **Electrical Tape**
   - Used for securing and insulating wires, connectors, or other components that need to be kept in place or protected from short circuits.

## 14. **Screen: 5-inch HDMI Display 800x480 XPT2046 Pixel**
   - Allows the user to view the camera feed, interact with the system’s interface, or adjust settings. This small, portable display makes the system more user-friendly and is ideal for portable setups.
